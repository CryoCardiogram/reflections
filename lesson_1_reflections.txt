You can focus on each line that has been changed and find the bug.
How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
It allows me to undo an action to go back to a previous version whenever I want to.
What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
pros - each commit as a logical meaning. cons - prone to users errors.
Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Because one change can affect multiple files.
How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
by... using them ? 
How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
git checkout ?
Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
I want to try it with a larger program of mine!
