What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Git creates a .git hidden folder. We need it so that the system knows that the current directory is a git repository.
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
We can choose the file we want to be committed which grants more control.
